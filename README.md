## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about CSS blend modes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Blend Modes](https://highrise.digital/blog/css-blend-modes/) - This goes over CSS blend modes. I'm familiar with them in painting and photo editing software, but didn't know you could use them with CSS.
- [CSS Background Overlays](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/how-to-css-after-elements-for-background-overlays/) - This is an article that goes over how to create color overlays on background images. I'm not unfamiliar with the practice, but I still have to look up the syntax for linear gradients when I implement them.
